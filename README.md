Exploring python 
It's been a LONG time..
The minestkinter folder now has a rehash of Alper & Metehan's minesweeper.
Not as polished but possibly more fun :)
2019-03-25 I used pyinstaller to make a windows exe, so if you want to just try the game you can download https://github.com/fazl/python/minestkinter.exe if you have a windows PC.  Er.. please don't forget to do your homeworks though.  LOL.
